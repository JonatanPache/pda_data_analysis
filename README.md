## Data Analysis projects


This is a compilations of data analysis projects that I have worked on. Each project is in its own directory and contains a README file with a description of the project, the data used, and the analysis performed. The projects are organized by topic.

The projects are organized into the following categories:



# Requirements
- Python 3.13 or later
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Statsmodels


# Setup
1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/JonatanPache/pda_data_analysis.git
cd pda
```

2. Create a virtual environment with pipenv:

```bash
pipenv shell
pipenv sync
```

If you don't have pipenv installed, you can install it with:

```bash
pip install pipenv
```
